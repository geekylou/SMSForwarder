# SMSForwarder

This is a Android app a wrote for forwarding SMS messages between devices using bluetooth.  
This was also a demonstration of the feasability of using a binary protocol designed for my home automation system for displaying 
data from my phone (hence using a custom protocol instead of json).
The project was never publicly released due to problems with bluetooth on older android devices.
